      "content": "Global electricity demand continues to rise as industries expand and urban populations grow. Power systems are under increasing pressure to handle higher loads and maintain reliability across expanding networks. The need for smarter infrastructure has become more urgent than ever, especially with the rise of smart grid technologies. According to Kings Research, the substation automation market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.87% through 2032, reflecting the increasing focus on modernizing power infrastructure and improving operational efficiency across networks. Substation automation systems play a central role in smart power distribution systems by enabling faster monitoring and control. Industry players are adopting these solutions to improve visibility, strengthen reliability, and support evolving grid modernization efforts across complex networks. The U.S. electric grid includes over 600,000 miles of transmission lines and more than 1 million megawatts of generating capacity, h",

For EPC contractors, utility companies, industrial facility owners, and renewable energy developers, transformer installation is not merely a technical operation\u2014it is a strategic investment decision. Cables form the physical and electrical link between the electrical transformer and the wider electrical system. Improper cable selection can result in overheating, insulation failure, electric shocks, unexpected downtime, and even regulatory non-compliance. From real-world engineering experience, many transformer failures are not caused by the transformer itself, but by incorrect cable types , undersized conductors, or unsuitable insulat",
