The incident, tracked under issue ID MO1237461 , began at approximately 8:22 PM IST (2:52 PM UTC) on February 23, 2026, and remains under active investigation. Users attempting to complete MFA challenges are encountering 504 Gateway Timeout responses, effectively blocking access to Microsoft 365 applications, portals, and any downstream services that rely on MFA as part of their authentication flow. The 504 error indicates that an upstream server, in this case, likely within Microsoft\u2019s authentication infrastructure, is failing to respond within the expected time window, causing the gateway layer to return a timeout to the end user. Microsoft confirmed the incident on its service health dashboard",

Endpoint security refers to the methods organizations use to protect the devices that connect to their networks and systems. An endpoint can be any device that acts as an access point to a protected network or digital asset. This includes typical work devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, as well as other interconnected devices like printers, IoT devices, point-of-sale technology, and more. Cybercriminals target all of these devices to gain unauthorized access and launch attacks. As organizations adopt remote work, hybrid cloud networks, and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, the volume and variety of endpoints they must manage grow significantly. This expanded attack surface makes endpoint security critical for maintaining data integrity, preventing breaches, and safeguarding business operations.
