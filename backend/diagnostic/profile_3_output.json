On Thursday, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published new guidance that calls for consistent supervision of algorithmic trading, clarifies its expectations for regulating firms that engage in algo trading and provides regulators with tools designed to facilitate that oversight. Among other things, the guidance seeks to address the results of a compliance review, which found that while most firms have integrated pre-trade controls into their risk management frameworks, the implementation of these controls isn\u2019t consistent and firms\u2019 governance of these controls isn\u2019t always robust.

The consultation accelerates the move to a more proportionate, outcomes\u2011based framework, including simpler due\u2011diligence requirements, more flexible approaches to non\u2011UK risk retention and asset\u2011class\u2011specific transparency standards. These reforms modernise the regime while preserving strong investor protection. The UK aims to improve market functioning, support issuance and enhance its competitiveness across both public and private securitisation markets. For investors, the implications are meaningful. A more principles\u2011led framework should ease access to global securitisation markets, including asset classes that have historically been constrained by more prescriptive EU\u2011style rules.

Seawater pH fluctuations during the OST are caused by declining atmospheric pCO\u2082, sea level fall and carbonate weathering. The fluctuation of seawater pH exerted a crucial role in the climatic changes and biotic evolutions during the OST. Abstract Environmental changes during the Ordovician to Silurian transition (OST) and the cause of Late Ordovician Mass Extinctions (LOMEs) remain a subject of debate. This study presents the first continuous seawater pH record spanning the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian, based on carbonate boron isotope (\u03b4 11 B carb ) data obtained from a carbonate-dominated section in South China. Our results reveal predominantly stable \u03b4 11 B carb values throughout the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian, punctuated by a positive \u03b4 11 B carb excursion during the Hirnantian coinciding with Gondwana glaciation.
