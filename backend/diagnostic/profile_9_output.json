The incident, tracked under issue ID MO1237461 , began at approximately 8:22 PM IST (2:52 PM UTC) on February 23, 2026, and remains under active investigation. Users attempting to complete MFA challenges are encountering 504 Gateway Timeout responses, effectively blocking access to Microsoft 365 applications, portals, and any downstream services that rely on MFA as part of their authentication flow. The 504 error indicates that an upstream server, in this case, likely within Microsoft\u2019s authentication infrastructure, is failing to respond within the expected time window, causing the gateway layer to return a timeout to the end user. Microsoft confirmed the incident on its service health dashboard",

Instead of waiting for equipment failures or relying solely on manual inspections, organisations are deploying machine learning, artificial intelligence and advanced analytics to optimise maintenance scheduling and reduce costly downtime. In many industrial facilities, robotic diagnostics are now aligned with structured systems such as velappity\u2019s hvac preventive maintenance software to ensure predictive maintenance processes integrate with enterprise asset management frameworks across different locations. This shift represents more than incremental improvement.
